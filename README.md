# Birds-Distributions

#  The FeederWatch data consists of bird species abundance reports from citizen scientistâ€™s home bird feeders. Participants select a two-day observation period as often as once per week from early November to early April. During each period, participants note the maximum number of individuals of each species seen at one time within their count site, and report that number to the FeederWatch database.
